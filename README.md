=============

This web app is built with AngularJS for poor internal vice-president/manager to manange shifts for their society easily.


### How to Use

    It is fairly straight forward to use it. First, select the peroid when your society sets counters, and confirm the dates afterwards. Second, type in the excos' name and click on add to add exco into the list above. Toggle the switch to determine if this exco is available at that timeslot. Finally, click on "Arrange Shift", and the app will displays the dates with assigned excos.
